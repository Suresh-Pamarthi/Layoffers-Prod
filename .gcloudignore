# This file specifies files that are not uploaded to Google Cloud
# when using `gcloud app deploy` or `gcloud builds submit`.
#
# If you would like to add files to the ignore list (optional), add
# them to a .gcloudignore file in the root directory. Each line is
# a file glob pattern relative to the root directory. Files in the
# node_modules directory are always ignored, as are most hidden files
# and Python files.
